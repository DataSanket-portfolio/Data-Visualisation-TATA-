# TATA Virtual Internship – Data Visualization Project

## Job Simulation Objective

As part of a virtual internship experience with TATA, I completed a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project focused on uncovering key business insights for executive stakeholders.

## Data Overview:
The dataset provided included the following columns:

- Invoice Number
- Stock Code
- Description
- Quantity
- Invoice Date
- Unit Price
- Customer ID
- Country
- Order Price

## Tools & Technology
Excel (Power Query for data transformation)

Tableau (for building interactive visual dashboards)

### Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation:
- Used Power Query in Excel for data transformation and cleanup.

- Handled negative values, ensured correct data types, and created calculated fields like Order_Price (if not already present).

### Step 2: Business Question Formulation:

- To prepare for stakeholder meetings, I developed 8 strategic questions—4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO—based on both operational and marketing lenses.
- These questions helped guide the direction of the visualizations and data storytelling.

### Step 3: Visualizations Built in Tableau

I selected and designed 4 key visuals to answer the business questions:

- Top 10 Countries by Revenue & Order Quantity

    -- To identify top-performing regions and evaluate market focus.

- Revenue Over Time (Time Series)

    -- To observe trends, seasonality, and sales performance over time.

- Top Customers by Revenue

    -- To identify high-value clients and evaluate retention potential.

- Demand by Region/Country

    -- To assess regional demand patterns and support strategic planning.


# Outcome:

- This project provided hands-on experience in data transformation, executive-level business analysis, and data visualization using real-world datasets. It sharpened my skills in storytelling with data, asking the right business questions, and effectively communicating insights through visuals.

### 3) Top Customer by Revenue
The CEO can focus on Top customers and try to understand whether the company is overly dependent on a few customer or whether the revenue is evenly divided.
